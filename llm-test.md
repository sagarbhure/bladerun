History is the study of past events, particularly those involving human societies. It involves examining records,
artifacts, and other sources to understand how people lived, what they valued, and how they interacted with each other 
and their environment over time. By analyzing these elements, historians aim to reconstruct and interpret the experiences
and actions of individuals and groups, providing insights into how societies have evolved and how past events shape the
present and future.
